# Mercury CLI

## Overview

`mercury-cli` is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify using the [Mercury OCIP](https://github.com/Fourteen-IP/mercury-ocip) Library. All automations and operations that can be performed using Mercury OCIP can now be executed through an intuitive CLI with autocomplete functionality.

### Example

```asciinema-player
{
    "file": "assets/asciinema/autocomplete-example.cast",
    "title": "Autocomplete Showcase",
    "mkap_theme": "none",
    "theme": "dracula",
    "fit": "width",
    "cols": 120,
    "rows": 24,
    "autoplay": true
}
```

## Installation

To install `mercury-cli`, use pip:

```bash
pip install mercury-cli
```

You can then run the CLI using the following command:

```bash
mercury_cli
```

This runs the module and starts the interactive CLI session. From here you can run commands and do some automations!

See the Commands section for more details on commands and features available in `mercury_cli`.

## Quick Login

You can pass parameters to `mercury-cli` when starting it from the command line. For example:

```bash
mercury_cli --username your.username --password-env YOUR_PASSWORD_ENV_VARIABLE --host https://mercury.example.com/webservice/services/ProvisioningService
```

This will drop you directly into the CLI with the provided credentials.
